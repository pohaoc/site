teaching:
  - title: "CS200: Applied Algorithmic Problem Solving"
    conf: "Lecturer"
    summary: In this course, we introduce tricks and algorithmic techniques that students are not typically exposed to in a conventional program. Students will learn to approach problems similar to those seen in programming competition or difficult interview questions and learn to implement their solutions in working code, putting the learned theories to practice in real applications.
