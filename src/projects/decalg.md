        Can decentralized parallel algorithms beat their centralized counterparts?

        This is my final project in BU's "EC724: Advanced Optimization Theory" for PhD students.
        In this self-contained exposition, we look at the well-known Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm by Lian et al. and analyze the benefit of decentralization in parallel algorithm design.
        I break down some of the complex analysis and summarize the crucial techniques used in the paper.

        Note: the main content of the exposition is derived from the original paper. I simply give the intuitive perspective to fill in the gaps, as well as my own thoughts.
